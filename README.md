### Level 3

Archer's Intuition: When you play a \"Ranged Attack\" card, refund 1 Energy and apply 3 Sight to all enemies. (3 times/turn)

Powerful Enchantment: Burn can recude 0.7% fire resistance and 0.3% pierce resistance per stack. Chill can increase 1 pierce damage received per stack. When you hit a monster with Spark, it also deals 30% of the target's Spark charges as Lightning damage.

### Level 5

Arrow With Hawk: Sharp +2. Upon pickup, replaces your pet slot with \"Harley\" corrupted version. When you play a \"Ranged Attack\", card put a random \"Ranged Attack\" card in your hand with cost 0 and vanish. (4 times/turn).

Element Lockï¼š When you apply Burn, Chill or Spark, apply X Sight to target (X is the charges of you apply) (Not effects with item).

I'll be modifying this data frequently to make balance. So the picture maybe isn't the true number. You can check them out at the Town of Knowledge in game.

## Support

I will keep watching for cards strength, try to make sure these cards display their strength that should be there. Create a real magic archer instead of only using sharp to deal damage.

Hope you enjoy it and if have any idea or bug, just open a github issue or make a post in the **modding #support-and-requests** channel of the [official Across the Obelisk Discord](https://discord.gg/across-the-obelisk-679706811108163701).
